Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Via Pip
^^^^^^^

To install via ``pip``, you can run the following

::

    $ pip install neet

Note that on some systems this will require administrative privileges. If you
don't have admin privileges or would prefer to install **Neet** for your user
only, you do so via the ``--user`` flag:

::

    $ pip install --user neet

From Source
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/elife-asu/neet
    $ cd neet
    $ python setup.py test
    $ pip install .

System Support
--------------

So far the python wrapper has been tested under ``python2.7``, ``python3.4`` and
``python3.5``, and on the following platforms:

* Debian 8
* Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
* Windows 10
